### Getting started

3. Set distance thresholds for each category
4. Use the ruler or place templates to see narrative ranges

### Settings

- Enabled toggle
- Melee/Very Close/Close/Far/Very Far distances

### Features

- Works with ruler and templates
- Scene-appropriate narrative display
- GM-configurable thresholds per world
- Grid-agnostic: works with theater-of-the-mind and grid play

### Tips

- Set Melee very low to reflect adjacent token interactions
- Tune Close vs Far to match your table’s grid scale
- Keep ranges broad for faster play; avoid overly granular thresholds
