3. Choose a preset or tweak appearance options
4. Roll to see the changes immediately

### Options

- Per-die type: Hope, Fear, Advantage, Disadvantage
- Appearance: color, material, pips, outline, glow, edge finish
- Preset management: save, load, reset per die type

### Presets

- Built-in presets per die type
- Save custom presets and switch quickly before a session
- Reset to default if needed

### Per-user behavior

- Choices affect only your 3D dice view
- Other users keep their own presets

### Roll integration

- Criticals and rerolls keep your selected appearance

### Tips
