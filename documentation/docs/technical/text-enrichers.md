### Duality Enricher

Creates clickable links for inline `/dr` commands.

### Resource Enricher

Turns resource phrases into buttons for hope/fear/stress/hp/armor.

### How it works

- Scans rendered HTML for patterns and replaces with interactive elements
- Respects exclusion phrases to avoid unintended actions

### Examples

```markdown
[[/dr trait=agility modifier=1]]{Agility Check}
spend 1 hope
clear 1 stress
```

### Tips

- Keep phrases simple for consistent detection
- Use inline commands where structured control is required
