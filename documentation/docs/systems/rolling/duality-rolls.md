### What it is

Duality rolls use a Hope die and a Fear die together. The system labels results (Critical, Hope, Fear) and applies resource changes automatically.

### Quick start

- From your sheet: click a roll button
- Use the Duality Roll popup to set options, then Roll

Youâ€™ll see both dice in chat with a summary of outcomes and any automatic Hope/Stress changes.

### When to use

- Action checks, contests, or anytime the rules call for Hope/Fear
- Reaction rolls by adding `reaction=true`

### Getting started

1. Select or open your character
2. Click a roll button to open the Duality Roll popup
3. Configure options like `trait`, `modifier`, `advantage`, or `disadvantage`
4. Read the result banner (Critical, Hope, Fear) and apply outcomes

### Using the roll popup

1. Click a roll button on your sheet
2. In the popup, set trait/modifier and optional advantage/disadvantage or reaction
3. Press Roll to send results to chat

### For power users

```javascript
await game.daggerheart.rollHandler.rollDuality({
  hopeDieSize: 'd12',
  fearDieSize: 'd12',
  modifier: 0,
  advantage: { d6: 1 },
  disadvantage: { d4: 1 },
  sendToChat: true,
});
```
