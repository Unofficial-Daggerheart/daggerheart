### How to use

1. Click Damage from the attack message, or open a damage action that shows the dialog
2. Edit the base formula if needed
3. Toggle any modifiers you want to include
4. Roll

### For power users

### Common uses

- Weapon attacks that include extra damage options
- Spells with multiple damage components
- Rolling with proficiency-based dice patterns (e.g., d12 per proficiency)

### Tips

- Use the preview to confirm the final formula before rolling
- Toggle only the modifiers relevant to this attack to avoid double counting
- If proficiency is not applied, ensure source actor is a character and formula uses proficiency dice syntax
