title: Damage Application
---

### What it is

Damage and healing apply directly to targeted or selected tokens. Characters use thresholds and armor slots to determine how many Hit Points are marked.

### Typical flow (players)

1. Make an attack roll
2. Click the Damage button that appears on the chat message
3. Select targets on the canvas
4. Confirm damage application

Armor slots can reduce the HP marked for characters.

### Selecting targets

- Target tokens (T) to limit who gets affected
- If no targets, selected tokens are used

Priority:

1. Targeted tokens
2. Selected tokens
3. Error if none are found

### Undo

Made a mistake? Use the Undo button in the damage chat message to revert.

### Death Moves

When a character reaches the dying state, the sheet shows a death overlay you can click to trigger Death Moves. The dialog guides Blaze of Glory, Avoid Death (with roll and scar handling), and Risk it All with automated chat results.

### For power users

```javascript
await applyDamage(targets, amount, source, true, armorSlotsUsed);
await applyDirectDamage(targets, hpAmount, source, true);
await applyHealing(targets, healAmount, source, true);
await undoDamageHealing(undoId);
```

### Thresholds

- Below Major: 1 HP
- At/above Major: 2 HP
- At/above Severe: 3 HP

### Buttons in chat

Damage and Undo controls appear directly on attack and damage messages.

### Tips

- If nothing happens: check that tokens are targeted/selected and have a health system
- Armor: increase or decrease armor slots on the character to change reduction
